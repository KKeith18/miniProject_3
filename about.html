        Our Project Intention
      </h2>
      <p>
        We decdied to analyze the effects of vaccinations on the death rate
        within the United States as it is a relevent topic. Specficially
        we decided to highlight the most vaccinated state (Mass) and the least
        vaccinated state (Miss). We also wanted to compare these states'
        policies effectiveness compared to overal impact of corona on America . To do so we
        included a national graph of American cases and deaths. In doing so we
        can see how affected America is and how different states are dealing witht this problem.

        In order to do so we decided to use bar charts with lines on them with
        the x axis representing the time progression and y being our values. To
        do so we used data from the following

      <p>
        We sat down and drew various graphs as we were collectiley working on
        the project. The reaosn being so that we all understood what our desired
        end product would look like. However on more than one occasion we
        realized what we had didn't portray exactly what we wanted.

      <h2>
        Our Problems
      </h2>
      <p>
        We initially wanted to attempt to compare between the blue and red
        states but finding data on that was rather difficult on that
      </p>
      <p>
        We ran into various decoding issues along the way including but not
        limited to having our graph interact in unitended ways. On top of that
        we struggled to implement d3 in glitch and as a result worked on VSCode
        for most of the process. The hardest part was probably trying to work on
        the project at the same time in glitch as it constantly updates. Another problem was
        that we couldnt neccasarily find a death rate which makes comparing states difficult
        as they have different populations thus we solved that by calculating it ourselves.

      <h2>
        Our Takeaways
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the biggest lessons learned is that in the future we should
        probably establish a group git repository in which we can all push our
        changes to rather than use glitch as not only is it slow but hard for
        people to work on at the same time.

      <p>
        Keith and Patrick did a majority of the work as Harry was quite confused
        on the update part of d3 in the bar charts.
